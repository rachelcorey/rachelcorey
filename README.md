### Portfolio
#### Here are a couple projects from the past few years:

#### AI-House
*Coming soon....*

#### HomeForUs
**Group Project for Databases class**
[Github repo]() [Demo Video]()
**Tools used:**
*Java, Java Swing, MySQL*
**My share of work in the group:**
Program architecture: 99%
GUI coding: 80%
Database design: 20%
SQL queries: 10%

#### Checkers
**Project for Software Quality class**
**Tools used:**
*Java, JavaFX, Photoshop*
This is a small checkers game I made for one of my school assignments. I created all of the graphics and wrote all of the code. It is a standard checkers game program, and allows for multi-jumping opponents' pieces. You can either play locally with another person, or against a primative AI. 
Unfortunately, I am not permitted to post the code I wrote online for this assignment, as my professor has told me it would be an academic integrity violation; hopefully the example in the picture above gives you a good enough idea about what it's like.

#### Networked Tic-Tac-Toe
**Project for Software Quality class**
**Tools used:**
*Java, JavaFX, Photoshop*
This is a small tic-tac-toe game I made for one of my school assignments. I created all of the graphics and wrote all of the code. It is a standard tic-tac-toe game program, where you can connect to another client of the program on a local network and play together with someone else.
Unfortunately, I am not permitted to post the code I wrote online for this assignment, as my professor has told me it would be an academic integrity violation; hopefully the example in the picture above gives you a good enough idea about what it's like.
